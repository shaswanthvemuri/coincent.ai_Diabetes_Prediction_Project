Abstract;
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data. By employing various classification models, the study achieves impressive performance in predicting diabetes. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to identify significant patterns and insights from the dataset.

Objective;
To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on patient data.

Introduction;
Diabetes is a major global health concern, affecting an estimated 463 million people worldwide, with type 2 diabetes accounting for 90% of all cases. Lifestyle factors such as sedentary behavior, poor diet, and obesity, particularly in urban areas, contribute significantly to its prevalence. However, aging populations and genetic predispositions also play a crucial role, with certain ethnic groups having a higher risk.
Early diagnosis is critical for effective management and prevention of complications, which can include heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, and blindness. Uncontrolled diabetes was responsible for an estimated 1.5 million deaths globally in 2019. Predictive analytics, leveraging data patterns and algorithms, can aid in identifying individuals at risk before symptoms manifest by analyzing factors like genetics, lifestyle habits, and medical history.
These personalized risk assessments enable targeted interventions such as lifestyle modifications, preventive medication, or closer monitoring, potentially delaying or preventing the onset of diabetes. This proactive approach improves health outcomes and reduces the substantial economic burden associated with managing advanced stages of the disease.

Steps;
1. Load the dataset and explore its structure.
2. Preprocess the data, handling missing values and normalizing features.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train various machine learning models: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
5. Evaluate the models using accuracy scores.
6. Visualize data distributions and correlations to understand feature significance.
7. Scale the data for models requiring normalization.

Methodology;
The dataset used for predictive analytics in diabetes includes various features relevant to diabetes risk prediction. Data preprocessing involves normalizing and handling missing values using mean and median substitution techniques. Different models such as Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) are tested to evaluate their performance in classifying diabetes based on patient data. The models are trained on the preprocessed data and evaluated using accuracy scores. Visualizations such as correlation heatmaps, KDE plots, and violin plots explore the relationships between features and the target variable.

Conclusion;
The developed machine learning models demonstrated strong performance in predicting diabetes, with accuracy scores indicating their efficiency. The potential impact on healthcare providers includes aiding in early diagnosis and personalized treatment plans, leading to more effective management of the condition and improved patient outcomes. For patients, this approach means better quality of care, reduced healthcare costs, and potentially a higher quality of life through proactive disease management and prevention strategies. They visualized data distributions and correlations and provided insights into significant features affecting diabetes prediction.
